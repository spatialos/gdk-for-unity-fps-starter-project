    - Place GameObjects with TileTypeVolume components into a prefab to control where to spawn those tiles in the world.
    - Specify the above TileTypeVolumes prefab to use inside MapBuilderSettings config object.
    - Specify a 'default' TileTypeCollection to use in the MapBuilderSettings to use if no volume found at a tile location.

## `0.1.5` - 2019-02-21

### Added

- Added a Deployment Launcher window. This allows you to upload assemblies and launch deployments from the Unity Editor.
- Added two launch configurations: `cloud_launch_large_sim_players.json` and `cloud_launch_small_sim_players.json` for simulated player deployments.

### Fixed

- The Editor now imports NavMeshes correctly when you first open the FPS project.

### Changed

- A simulated player now connects as a regular `UnityClient` worker rather than a `SimulatedPlayer` worker.
- In cloud deployments, `SimulatedPlayerCoordinator` workers are ran in a separate deployment to the `UnityGameLogic` workers.

	- Replaced transition runtime v2 templates from all launch configurations.
	- Updated cloud launch configurations to use the new `w4_r1000_e1` template.

	- Reduced checkout radius of `UnityClient` and `UnityGameLogic` workers from 210 to 150.
- Increased the level size from 868x868 to 1732x1732.
- Changed how level generation and `MapBuilder.cs` works.
	- `LoadWorld()` now generates the level GameObject through `MapBuilder`, instead of instantiating it from a prefab.
