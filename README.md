## About

The GDK for Unity First-Person Shooter (FPS) Starter Project is an example implementation of an FPS-genre game on top of the [SpatialOS GDK for Unity](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity). It features:

* Basic player spawning, movement, and shooting systems.
* An implementation of simulated players for load-testing.
* Variable-sized map generation.

> Note: The FPS Starter Project is _not_ production ready. For example, the shooting and movement systems are client-side authoritative. If you shipped a game based on the FPS Starter Project without hardening these systems, these systems would be vulnerabilities that a bad actor could exploit.
