## Why yet another license?

We believe that SpatialOS is unique in the capabilities that it gives you access to and our developers have put a
significant amount of effort in shaping the code that helps you benefit from these capabilities. While we want to
offer you the results of these efforts freely, we also feel that existing open source licenses do not provide
the necessary protection against the misuse of our software by competing platforms. The result is this license
which is as close to the open source spirit as possible while still providing us with the protection that we want.


## Where does this license come from?

This license draws for the largest part from open source licenses with their entrenched rights to copy, modify,
share and commercialise derived projects. Additionally there are two clauses that make it clear that:

* Our source code and anything derived from it is only intended for use on SpatialOS, thereby excluding any competing platforms.
* Improbable should always be identified as author within any derived projects but that, as an author of a derived project, you should feel free to add your own name to the author listing.


## How does this license affect my work and contributions?

In most, if not all, cases this license should not affect your work and contributions in any significant way.
You are more than welcome to use the published source code in your own projects, to modify it, improve it and
redistribute it. You are even free to use it to build and sell your own product. The only thing we ask is that
any projects derived from our source code are not used on a competing platform (but you are free to use them
in a single player game if that’s what you fancy ;) ).
